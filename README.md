# Machine Learning Basic Algorithms

This analytical study was executed using the R-programming language and the two datasets used were
sourced from the UC Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. The first dataset comprises of
two separate files, representing the training and testing data, and both data have a binary data
structure. The other dataset is a single multiclass data from which the training and testing data
were sampled. Machine learning algorithms, comprising of Decision Tree, Support Vector
Machine (SVM), and Perceptron, were implemented on the datasets, and the classification
accuracy of each algorithms were reported. Last, the prediction accuracy of each algorithm
considered in the analysis of both datasets were summarized in a tabular format.
